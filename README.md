# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP Algorithm (ML)

## Overview

This project implements **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with **Machine Learning** algorithms. The objective is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments by applying text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training steps.

The model can be used to gauge public opinion on a specific topic, event, or brand by analyzing the sentiment expressed in real-time tweets.

## Project Features

- **Data Collection**: Uses the Twitter API to fetch real-time tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and other NLP techniques.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies tweets as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using a trained machine learning model.
- **Model Training**: Implements popular classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the distribution of sentiments and model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_using_NLP_Algorithm_ML.git
   cd Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_using_NLP_Algorithm_ML
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Twitter API credentials:
   
   - Sign up for a developer account at [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/).
   - Create a new app and generate your API keys and access tokens.
   - Add your credentials to a `.env` file or in the script where Twitter API is used.

   Example `.env` file:

   ```bash
   CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
   CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   ```

## Dataset

You can either use a pre-existing dataset (such as the **Sentiment140** dataset) or collect real-time tweets using the Twitter API. The dataset must contain labeled tweets for supervised learning, where each tweet is marked as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

## Model Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Tweets are collected from the Twitter API or from a dataset.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and transformation of raw text into a suitable format for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Uses techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: Multiple ML models are trained and validated. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM can be used.
5. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to classify the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.
6. **Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
7. **Visualization**: Generates graphs and charts to visualize sentiment distribution and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `nltk` or `spaCy`: For NLP preprocessing tasks
  - `tweepy`: To interact with the Twitter API
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizing results
  - `Flask` or `Streamlit` (optional): For deploying the model as a web app
- **Twitter API**: For collecting real-time tweets

## Usage

1. Run the script to collect tweets and preprocess the text data:

   ```bash
   python collect_and_preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model using the collected data:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Test the model and classify the sentiment of live tweets:

   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

4. Optionally, deploy the model as a web application to classify tweets in real-time.
